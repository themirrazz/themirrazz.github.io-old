                        SecurlyNoise is a program developed by themirrazz that prevents teachers from using Securly<br>to snoop on you. However, since Securly is also a content blocking/censoring program, teachers<br>also have the ability to block this site. Which is why it's open-source,<br>and licensed under GNU AGPL 3.0, and on multiple locations. Instead<br> of using a proxy, it makes direct requests to Securly, meaning you can even<br>download the source of the website and run it locally without any problems (unless, of course, you aren't connected to the internet). We also have plans for a Chrome Extension version, as well as an Electron App (to keep it running in the background), and we're expecting more versions to popup since it's open source.
