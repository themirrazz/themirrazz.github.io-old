# Scratch Desktop for Windows96 (Unofficial)
## IMPORTANT! This is not affialited with the Scratch Team or MIT!

Scratch Desktop for Windows96 is
* **NOT** an official version of Scratch. It may not always work correctly.
* **NOT** maintained by MIT **OR** the Scratch Team. This is maintained by me, and is, again, an *unofficial* port.
* in beta. Many assets may be missing, we're working on collecting all the assets.

If you find an issue and would like it, **DO NOT** submit it to this repo.

Please submit it to the Scratch Desktop for Windows96 repo, [themirrazz/scratchdesktop96](https://github.com/themirrazz/scratchdesktop96)
